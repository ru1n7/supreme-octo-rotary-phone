    <h1>LSD Problem</h1>
    <h2>By Sefa, Mr.Ivex</h2>
    <p>What would happen if you Asked the entities for some DMT<br>
And smoked more DMT inside DMT-World?<br>
Do you think you need help with your LSD problem?<br>
Do you think you need help with your LSD problem?<br>
This is in relation to when you have a DMT breakthrough<br>
And you're surrounded by what you perceive to be entities that<br>
Are completely outside of you consciousness<br>
And human existence is the result of a DMT trip<br>
Do you think you need help with your LSD problem?</p>
